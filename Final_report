# **Traffic Sign Recognition** 

## Goal

### Write a CNN framework to analyze the traffic sign pictures.

---

**Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Project**

The steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Data Set Summary & Exploration

#### 1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.

I used the pandas library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic
signs data set:

* The size of training set is 34799
* The size of the validation set is 4410
* The size of test set is 12630
* The shape of a traffic sign image is (32, 32, 3)
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43


#### 2. Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset.

Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It is a bar chart showing how the data ...

### Design and Test a Model Architecture

#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)

As a first step, I decided to convert the images to YUV. Then I applied CLAHE to increase the contrast of the image.

Finally, I standarlized the image. I only use the Y channel for training.

#### 2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.

My final model consisted of the following layers:

| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input         		| 32x32x1 Y Channle Only image   				| 
| Convolution        	| 1x1 stride, same padding, outputs 32x32x64 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 28x28x6 				    |
| Convolution   	    | 1x1 stride, same padding, outputs 10x10x16    |
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 5x5x16 				    |
| Flatten + Random Drop | outputs 400        				     		|
| Neutral Network    	| outputs 120       							|
| RELU					|												|
| Neutral Network    	| outputs 84        							|
| RELU					|												|
| Neutral Network    	| outputs 43        							|
| Logit					|												|


#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.

rate = 0.0008
EPOCHS = 20
BATCH_SIZE = 128

#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

My final model results were:
* training set accuracy of 99.1%
* validation set accuracy of 96.8% 
* test set accuracy of 95.3%

If a well known architecture was chosen:
* What architecture was chosen?
LeNet
* Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application?
It is recommended in the literature.
* How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well?
It has >93% on validation
 

### Test a Model on New Images

#### 1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.

Here are six German traffic signs that I found on the web:

| Image.    		    |    Difficulty 	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| ![alt text][image4]   | Easy  			                		    | 
| ![alt text][image5]   | Easy  			                		    | 
| ![alt text][image6]   | Easy  			                		    | 
| ![alt text][image7]   | Easy  			                		    | 
| ![alt text][image8]   | Easy  			                		    | 
| ![alt text][image10]  | Difficult since covered by snow    			|



#### 2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric).

Here are the results of the prediction:

| Image			        |     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Go straight or left	| Go straight or left   					    | 
| Bumpy road     		| Bumpy road									|
| Go straight or left	| Go straight or left							|
| General caution	    | General caution					 			|
| Speed limit (30km/h)	| Speed limit (30km/h)      					|
| Speed limit (60km/h)	| Ahead only    					|

The model was able to correctly guess 5 of the 6 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 83%. This is lower than the 95.4% of the test set.

#### 3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)

The code for making predictions on my final model is located in the 11th cell of the Ipython notebook.


| Probability		    |     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| 100%	                | Go straight or left   					    | 
| 100%	                | Bumpy road									|
| 100%	                | Go straight or left							|
| 100%	                | General caution					 			|
| 100%	                | Speed limit (30km/h)      					|
| 0%	                | Speed limit (60km/h)      					|

### (Optional) Visualizing the Neural Network (See Step 4 of the Ipython notebook for more details)
#### 1. Discuss the visual output of your trained network's feature maps. What characteristics did the neural network use to make classifications?

I look at the feature map of first CNN and it it clearly that it is trying to identify the feature of the number 30.
